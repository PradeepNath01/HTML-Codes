In her eyes, a universe does gleam,
A love so deep, it feels like a dream.
Her smile, a beacon in the darkest night,
With her, everything feels so right.
Her laughter, a melody, sweet and pure,
In her presence, my heart is sure.
I cherish each moment, every day,
With the girl i love, come what may.
Her kindness and grace, a gentle art,
She's the keeper of my hopeful heart.
With her, life's a dance, a song, a rhyme,
Forever together, till the end of time.
